### :alien: Your favorite fun-sized coder K E L S :purple_heart: 
Hi new person! My name is Kelsey (I mostly go by Kels) and I'm a Case Manager turned Coder. You'll definitely catch me calling myself a baby noob web dev as I continue to grow my skills and develop my own ideas. I'm passionate about creating meaningful connections through everything I do and hope that I'm able to add a little bit of sunshine with the code I make.

## If I'm not coding, catch me...
